# AI211 – Machine Learning Labs (IIT Ropar)

This repository contains my complete lab work for the **AI211: Machine Learning** course at **IIT Ropar**.

All lab assignments are implemented **from scratch** using Python and are maintained in a structured and reproducible manner. The goal of this repository is to provide an **end-to-end view** of the concepts covered in the course, including dataset generation, model implementation, experiments, visualizations, and written observations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each lab is organized into its own folder and typically contains:

- 📓 Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)  
  - Complete working code
  - Step-by-step implementation
  - Plots and experimental results  

- 📄 Report / Observations (`.pdf` or `.tex`)  
  - Clear explanations of results
  - Observations written from a learning perspective
  - Interpretation of plots and experiments  

- 📊 Figures / Outputs  
  - Graphs and visualizations generated during experiments

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Some of the key Machine Learning concepts covered across the labs include:

- PAC Learning and Threshold Hypotheses  
- Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)  
- Bias–Variance Tradeoff  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Gradient Descent and Analytical Solutions  
- Regularization (Ridge and Lasso)  
- Sample Complexity and VC Dimension  
- Realizable vs Agnostic Learning  
- Effect of Noise on Learning

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Pandas (where required)  

> **Note:** Direct use of high-level ML libraries (such as `scikit-learn` for regression models) is avoided, as per lab instructions.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Maintain all **AI211 lab assignments** in one place  
- Track learning progress over the semester  
- Serve as a reference for concepts implemented from scratch  
- Ensure reproducibility of experiments and results
